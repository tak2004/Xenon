# Xenon
Context sensitive compression of OpenGL native image formats.

# This project is no longer in development because ASTC delivers better quality with faster loading time and GPU support. A lossless compression of DXT is larger then do a lossy compression on the raw data till the same PSNR as DXT5 compression is reached. GPUs nowdays do a good job on creating the DXT out of raw data.
